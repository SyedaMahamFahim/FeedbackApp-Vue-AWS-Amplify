## Tutorial
For a step-by-step guide on how to build this application, refer to the detailed tutorial [here](#).

## Prerequisite

Before we start our journey, make sure you have the following:

1. **Vue3**: If you're not familiar with Vue.js, check out the [official guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html).
2. **AWS Account**: If you don't have one, no worries! Follow this [guide](https://k21academy.com/amazon-web-services/aws-solutions-architect/create-aws-free-tier-account/) to create a free-tier AWS account.
3. **Bootstrap**: We'll use Bootstrap for styling.
4. **Routing in Vue**: Familiarity with Vue Router.
5. **GraphQL**: Basic understanding of GraphQL.
6. **AWS Services**: S3, DynamoDB, IAM, Cognito, and Amplify.
7. **Git**: Version control is key.

## Features

1. **User Account Creation:**
   - Users can create accounts securely using AWS Cognito for authentication.
   - Follow the tutorial to integrate AWS Cognito and set up a user pool.

2. **Send Feedback:**
   - Authenticated users can use the provided feedback form to submit feedback.
   - The app stores feedback data securely in AWS DynamoDB and user images in an S3 bucket.
     
3. **Delete Feedback:**
   - Authenticated users have the ability to delete their submitted feedback.
   - The tutorial includes details on implementing the feedback deletion feature.

4. **View Other Feedback (Login Required):**
   - Users need to be logged in to view feedback submitted by others.
   - A secured environment ensures that only authenticated users can access and interact with feedback data.

# Environment Setup
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
